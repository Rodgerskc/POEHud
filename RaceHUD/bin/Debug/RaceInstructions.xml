          <msg>01) Run all the way to Tarren Mill in Hillsbrad Foothills  and get the FP there from the Bat Handler (60.19 in Hillsbrad).  You can just bypass the UC for now (no need to get UC's FP yet) and just follow the path shown on the map to get to Hillsbrad.  NOTES:  If you can, use aSwim Speed Potion to cross the lake.  Once you reach Alterac Mountains you can start grinding on some mobs along the way to Tarren Mill.  TIP:  Focus on killing some Snapjaw turtles along the shore and save theTurtle Meat for a later quest, I recommend obtaining at least 4Turtle Meat before moving on (you can get more later on), and remember to not sell them to a vendor!</msg>

If he is, abandon your current main pet and tame this pet as your new main pet. Broken Tooth is special because it has the fastest attack speed out of any pets in Classic WoW.  Faster attack speeds work great with the Frenzy talent.  If he is not there, don't worry, just move on and consider coming back later to grab him..</take>
